<h1>Flip Card Memory Game</h1>

<p>This memory game was created for my second milestone project, and the idea behind it is that it would work in conjunction with
the retro gaming website that I created for my initial project. With the memory game working as part of the site, I believe that a greater
user engagement can be created - be it reminding existing retro gamers of older characters, or engaging younger players with no prior
knowledge of retor gaming.</p>
<p>As acknowledged in my previous project, Games Revisited is very much a niche website. By adding more accessible content such as this meory game, it
is my hope that a broader audience can be engaged as well as the pre-existing audience.</p>
<h2>UX</h2>
<p>The main goal of creating this memory game was to add further connectivity between users on the retro gaming site. The characters
in the game are a mix of recognisable characters, along with some more niche characters. The reason for this is that if an odler retro gaming fan
decided to play the game with their kids, they could then introduce their kids to these older games after unveiling the characters in the memory game.</p>
