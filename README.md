<h1>Flip Card Memory Game</h1>

<p>This memory game was created for my second milestone project, and the idea behind it is that it would work in conjunction with
the retro gaming website that I created for my initial project. With the memory game working as part of the site, I believe that a greater
user engagement can be created - be it reminding existing retro gamers of older characters, or engaging younger players with no prior
knowledge of retro gaming.</p>
<p>As acknowledged in my previous project, Games Revisited is very much a niche website. By adding more accessible content such as this meory game, it
is my hope that a broader audience can be engaged as well as the pre-existing audience.</p>
<h2>UX</h2>
<p>The main goal of creating this memory game was to add further connectivity between users on the retro gaming site. The characters
in the current version of the game are all easily recognisable Nintendo characters, as a way to hopefully appeal to younger users - perhaps
the children of the typical visitor of a retro gaming site. My hope is that this would create greater visibility for the original site
by adding a sort of gateway for more casual or younger gaming fans.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a fan of retro gaming, who would like to play a fun game with my kids to show them gaming characters from my past, perhaps getting them interested in older games.</li>
<li>I am a fan of retro gaming who would like to discover games i haven’t played before in a fun and casual manner.</li>
<li>I’m a big fan of gaming, but am unfamiliar with older games, and I’d like to find out more.</li>
<li>I’m a frequent visitor of Games Revisited, and would like to see a little more fun and interactivity implemented in the site.</li>
<li>I would like to play a fun and interactive game to help me improve my memory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Revisitor features a hero image to act as a landing page. On this page the user will find the game title,
three buttons they can click to select their difficulty, and a div containing the rules of the game, and the difference in each version.
In my original wireframes, a form was included for the user to enter their username. This was removed, as ultimately there didn't seem to be much pointe
in having it there without a scoring system in place.</p>
