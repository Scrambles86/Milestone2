<h1>Flip Card Memory Game</h1>

<p>This memory game was created for my second milestone project, and the idea behind it is that it would work in conjunction with
the retro gaming website that I created for my initial project. With the memory game working as part of the site, I believe that a greater
user engagement can be created - be it reminding existing retro gamers of older characters, or engaging younger players with no prior
knowledge of retor gaming.</p>
<p>As acknowledged in my previous project, Games Revisited is very much a niche website. By adding more accessible content such as this meory game, it
is my hope that a broader audience can be engaged as well as the pre-existing audience.</p>
